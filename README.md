# School-Performance-Analysis
This repository contains a jupyter notebook which takes in two CSV files, one with school data and with student data, and uses it to create various pandas dataframes that illustrate statistics on school performance. The analysis looks at the student performance at different school size range, school type and per student budget ranges as well as the performance at each school in terms of math, reading and overall passing rates, including a per grade breakdown. A report on the findings is also included at the end of the notebook.
